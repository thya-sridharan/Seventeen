        Seventeen (세븐틴) is a South Korean boy group formed by Pledis Entertainment in 2015, known for their tight synchronization, self-producing talent, and unmatched stage presence. The group consists of 13 members divided into three specialized units:

        Hip-Hop Unit (S.Coups, Wonwoo, Mingyu, Vernon)

        Vocal Unit (Woozi, Jeonghan, Joshua, DK, Seungkwan)

        Performance Unit (Hoshi, Jun, The8, Dino)

        Despite the name "Seventeen," it represents 13 members + 3 units + 1 team = 17.

        Seventeen is often called a “self-producing idol group” because they actively participate in writing, composing, choreographing, and even producing their own content — led by members like Woozi (music production) and Hoshi (choreography).

        They debuted on May 26, 2015 with the mini album 17 Carat, and have since risen to become global K-pop powerhouses with hits like Don’t Wanna Cry, Very Nice, Left & Right, HOT, and Super.

        Their fandom name is CARAT, representing the fans who help Seventeen shine like diamonds.
